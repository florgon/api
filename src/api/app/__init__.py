    Florgon API server application.
    Provides full FastAPI API application with tests.

    How to run: Please see root source directory of the repository.
    For now application is based on Docker + Docker Compose.
    Tests: For testing please run `pytest` inside your docker server container.
    Configuration: Please specify settings inside `.server.env` in the repository source directory (Docker-Compose).
    Requirements: See `requirements.txt` in `..`. Should be installed at build time of docker container.
    
    Docker: Server should be instantiated with docker-compose as it requires PostgreSQL and Redis instances.
    Running without Docker: Notice that this is not recommended and supported, but you may try
    to run own instances of PostgreSQL + Redis and setup config, this will may work as should, but currently
    this way of instantiating the server is not recommended, please use docker and docker-compose instead.
