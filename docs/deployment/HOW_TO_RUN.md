# How to run.
Open `/src` directory and simply run `docker-compose up` with Docker installed and running on your machine. Docker-compose will install and run all required staff (including Postgresql database) and after that you may open `http://localhost:80` in your browser (sure, you may change ports using Docker).

## Configuration.
